# Snake-OOP
This project is a rebuild of my previous snake game project, to practice the use of Typescript and object oriented programming. Test Driven Development (TDD) was applied throughout the creation of this project to enforce best-practice coding. Styling was not the priority for this version of the game.

The next step will be to attempt this project using a front-end framework, such as Angular. This will allow for better testing of the code as, currently, functions that interact with the DOM (document object model) cannot be tested robustly.

Before modifications are made to this project, a yarn install or npm install must be run.
